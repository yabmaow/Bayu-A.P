          Hi! Iâ€™m Bayu Andika Putra, a Visual Communication Design student at Ma Chung University and a freelance Photographer & Videographer. With experience in capturing moments and conveying visual stories through editing, I founded
          Desiree Visual, a Production House dedicated to exploring creative ideas and diving deeper into the world of visual storytelling. I have a strong interest in documenting culture, music events, and unique concepts that bring art
          and expression together. In my spare time, I work on improving my English skills and am currently preparing for the TOEIC test. I am also expanding my knowledge in web development to enhance my understanding of design and
          technology. Always open to new collaborations, projects, and connecting with people who share a creative passion!

          <p>
            create music videos that bring songs to life through visual storytelling. By closely collaborating with artists, I understand their vision and the emotions they want to convey. Each video is designed to enhance the song's
